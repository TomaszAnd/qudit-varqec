"""Smoke + certification tests for scripts/seed_race.py.

Two contracts:
1. A small race (3 seeds x 50 steps, n=3/d=3/dist=2) completes quickly and
   persists an npz with full metadata whether or not a seed certifies.
2. The H1 fix: a theta whose SAMPLED loss is below target while its
   full-batch loss is not must NOT certify. Reuses the |kkk> fixture pattern
