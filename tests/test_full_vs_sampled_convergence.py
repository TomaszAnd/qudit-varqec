"""Lock in the H1 fix (audit/04): a sampled-subset loss below threshold must
never certify convergence — certification is full-batch only.

Construction: code states |000>, |111>, |222> (d=3, n=3, unclosed dist-3
model). Every off-diagonal detectability term vanishes (a weight-<=2 operator
cannot map |iii> to |jjj>), but ops with non-constant diagonal action (all
four single-qudit hardware ops, and diagonal-correlated pairs) give a nonzero
variance term, so the full KL loss is bounded away from zero. Ops like
X01 (x) X12 contribute exactly zero (diagonal product is identically 0).

A Hoeffding-uniform subsample that happens to draw only zero-contribution ops
reports a sampled loss of exactly 0 — the situation Ulrich's seed race accepts
as "TARGET REACHED" (verified against his code in audit/04 §H1: full loss
76.3, sampled 0.0 on 11% of keys). Any convergence/victory check must instead
certify on the full batch.
